# PhoenixBakery

<!-- start:PhoenixBakery -->
Better compression for your Phoenix assets.

This is set of modules that implement [`Phoenix.Digester.Compressor`][]
behaviour which can be used together with Phoenix 1.6 or later for better
compression of the static assets served by `Plug.Static`.

[`Phoenix.Digester.Compressor`]: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.6.0/Phoenix.Digester.Compressor.html

## Installation

First thing to do is to add `PhoenixBakery` as a dependency.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_bakery, "~> 0.1.0", runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

And configure your `Plug.Static`:

```elixir
plug Plug.Static,
  encodings: [{"zstd", ".zstd"}],
  gzip: true,
  brotli: true,
  # Rest of the optionsâ€¦
```

**WARNING**: Current release of Plug (1.12.1) do not support `:encodings` option
yet and this option is ignored. So Zstandard-compressed files will not be served
to the clients, even if client will have support for such format. Future
releases of Plug however should make it work as expected. See
[elixir-plug/plug#1050][pr-1050].

Then you need to configure your compressors via Phoenix configuration:

```elixir
config :phoenix,
  static_compressors: [
    # Pick all that you want to use
    PhoenixBakery.Gzip,
    PhoenixBakery.Brotli,
    PhoenixBakery.Zstd
  ]
```

[pr-1050]: https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug/pull/1050
<!-- end:PhoenixBakery -->

## Supported compressors

### `PhoenixBakery.Gzip`

<!-- start:PhoenixBakery.Gzip -->
Replacement of default [`Phoenix.Digester.Gzip`][] that provides better default
compression ratio (defaults to maximum possible) instead of default option that
compromises between compression speed and compression ratio.

It uses built-in `zlib` library, which mean, that there is no external
dependencies and it will work OotB on any installation.

#### Configuration

`PhoenixBakery.Gzip` provides 3 different knobs that you can alter via
application configuration:

```elixir
config :phoenix_bakery, :gzip_opts, %{
    level: :best_speed, # defaults to: `:best_compression`
    window_bits: 8, # defaults to: `15` (max)
    mem_level: 8 # defaults to: `9` (max)
  }
```

The shown above are defaults. For description of each option check [`zlib`
documentaion][erl-zlib]

[`Phoenix.Digester.Gzip`]: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.6.0/Phoenix.Digester.Gzip.html
[erl-zlib]: https://erlang.org/doc/man/zlib.html
<!-- end:PhoenixBakery.Gzip -->

### `PhoenixBakery.Brotli`

<!-- start:PhoenixBakery.Brotli -->
[Brotli][br] is algorithm that offers better compression ratio when compared
with Gzip, but at the cost of greater memory consumption during compression. It
provides quite good decompression speed. [It is supported by all major modern browsers][caniuse-br]

[br]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932
[caniuse-br]: https://caniuse.com/brotli

#### Requirements

To use `PhoenixBakery.Brotli` you need at least one of:

- Add `{:brotli, ">= 0.0.0", runtime: false}` to use NIF version of the Brotli
  compressor. It requires C code compilation and it can slow down compilation a
  little as the compilation isn't the fastest.
- Have `brotli` utility available in `$PATH` or configured via
  `config :phoenix_bakery, :brotli, "/path/to/brotli"`

If none of the above is true then compressor will raise.

#### Configuration

```elixir
config :phoenix_bakery,
  brotli_opts: %{
    quality: 5 # defaults to: `11` (max)
  }
```
<!-- end:PhoenixBakery.Brotli -->

### `PhoenixBakery.Zstd`

<!-- start:PhoenixBakery.Zstd -->
[Zstandard][zstd] is algorithm that offers quite good compression ratio when
compared with Gzip, but slightly worse than Brotli, but with much better
decompression speed. It is currently not supported by browsers, but is already
IANA standard, so the rollout of the support should be pretty fast.

[zstd]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878

#### Requirements

To use `PhoenixBakery.Zstd` you need at least one of:

- Add `{:ezstd, "~> 1.0", runtime: false}` to use NIF version of Zstd
  compressor. It requires C code compilation and `git` tool to be available to
  fetch the code of `zstandard` code.
- Have `zstd` utility available in `$PATH` or configured via
  `config :phoenix_bakery, :zstd, "<path-to-zstd-executable>/zstd"`

If none of the above is true then compressor will raise.

#### Configuration

```elixir
config :phoenix_bakery,
  zstd_opts: %{
    level: 10 # defaults to: `22` (ultra-max)
  }
```
<!-- end:PhoenixBakery.Zstd -->
